# About This Project

This is a website made by a group of high school friends for the HackFit hackathon (2021) hosted by MLH (Major League Hacking)

Through this website, we aim to educate young children about mental health with a "feelings sharing forum"!

We hope this can destigmatize the sharing of emotions to foster a generation of communicative and empathetic individuals.
