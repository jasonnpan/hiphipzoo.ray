Hi everyone! This is a website made by a group of high school friends for the HackFit hackathon.

Through this website, we aim to educate young children about mental health using stories, mini games, and a "feelings sharing forum"!

We hope this can destigmatize the idea of not hiding your feelings, and allow children to become more aware of their emotions.
